This new v2.0 quiz fixed the broken graphql service link.

The quiz is to build a simple Pokémon Search App, features are:

•	Support Android devices published in the last 2 years
•	When FIRST launch, display a welcome splash page
•	with any content, even pure text is acceptable
•	Home page
•	has a text input box and a search button
•	search button is grayed out when the text box is empty
•	You can choose an alternative design which will search while typing, so don’t need the search button
•	Debounce the search input if you choose not using the search button
•	when click the search button, search Pokémon species by the name field from the text input box
•	it’s a fuzzy search.
•	display a loading image while waiting for the response.
•	display species name, capture_rate, Pokémons under the species and use pokemon_v2_pokemoncolor.name as the list item’s background color
•	When click any Pokémon name, go to the Pokémon detail page
•	Paginate the search results in any page size you prefer
•	Pokémon detail page
•	Displays the Pokémon name and abilities name
•	A return button to go back to the Home page and retain the search result
•	The graphql service:
•	URL is https://beta.pokeapi.co/graphql/v1beta
•	The query you are going to use is pokemon_v2_pokemonspecies query fields may look like below screenshot, but figure out the query input (where variable) yourself  
•	A working App is enough, theming or UI enhancements are not required


This is just a simple example
